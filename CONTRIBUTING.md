# Contributing to the Qiskit Human Eval

Welcome and thank you for contributing to the Qiskit HumanEval!

If you are thinking to contribute to the Qiskit HumanEval, you agree to abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which we strongly recommend you read before continuing.

There are many ways of contributing from opening an issue to preparing a patch to updating documentation. Continue reading the contribution guidelines for opening new issues and submitting pull requests.

## Opening issues

Issues can be opened from <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-human-eval/issues> to report failures and misfunctions. Please do provide steps to reproduce and also expected behaviour.

## Contributing code

Feel free to view the [issues](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-human-eval/issues) in the repository to decide what to work on.

### Assigning yourself

The very first step to working on an issue is assigning yourself the issue. This gives all contributors the visibility into who is working on what.

### Setting up your development environment

Before you start working on an issue you will need to make sure you have the code cloned or forked. And you should be able to run and test the extension locally.

#### Development environment

Note: You will need Visual Studio Code and Node.js to contribute and work on the extension.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the qiskit-human-eval directory
# Make sure you are using Python 3.11 or greater
# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Working on an issue

When you are going to start working on an issue, make sure you are in your `main` branch and that it is up to date then create a new branch with a meaningful name.

When committing your changes do try to use descritive titles and informative summary notes.

### Opening pull requests

When you think your work is done, [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) against the `main` branch. In the pull request, provide a description and link with the issue that is being solved.

### Code review

Once you have sent a pull request, the code contributors get notified, and there will be a code review. The repository also contains some automated checks for pull requests . For a pull request to be ready for merging it needs to pass automatic checks and have, at least, one accepted review.

## Final words

Thank you for reading until the end of the document! Abiding by these guidelines you express your willingness in collaborating and contributing to the project in a healthy way. Thanks for that too!
